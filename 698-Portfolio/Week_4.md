**Week 4**

While working on a PowerPoint presentation this week, I thought about the role design was playing in the scholarly output I produced. I have no formal training in design, so I consider my design approach to be one of amateurism driven by instinct, abetted by technology, and constrained by the amount of time I have available to complete a project.

To illustrate: I had neither the time nor the skill set to create a good-looking PowerPoint from scratch. Thus, I went to templates. The presentation related to the Apollo 15 moon mission, and instinct told me to pick a theme that suggested outer space. I found a template close to what I wanted in the set of templates that came preloaded with my installation of PowerPoint. I could have searched for additional templates, but here the available time constrained my design choice. I decided to use the template that was close, and "make it work."

Using a template means my design ideas are filtered through the work done by the designer who built the template. I can't go so far as to call myself a collaborator with the designer of the template, but I'd like to think that I'm more than a freeloader. I locate template use in an ethos similar to that cultivated in the programming classes I have taken: yes, copying and pasting pre-existing code is lazy, but the culture doesn't frown upon it.   

My point with this illustration is to suggest that with the tools currently available, scholars can make their presentations, websites, reports, etc. look decently well-designed without having to earn an additional degree in art or graphic design. I think that design in scholarship should play the role of helping scholars to better communicate what they are trying to say.

As I mentioned earlier, I don't think scholars need to be full-time graphic designers, but I do see a role for design education as part of standard undergraduate and graduate training. This could include something like a course designed around a book such as Lupton's or some training workshops on Word and PowerPoint that focus on the features they include that can help with design.

I see design training becoming even more important for scholars as publication continues to move beyond print to the digital realm. While taking a course on web design, I became more aware of how the design of websites impacts how well they communicate. I also learned how design can help or hinder efforts to make websites accessible to those using screen readers and other assistive technology. If scholars plan to create and maintain their own websites or work in e-publications, they would benefit from design education.    

Although I think scholars would benefit from design education and design could play a larger role in scholarship, I don't think design should be part of peer review for all scholarly works. Of course, it should play a role if the project is design-related or has a heavy graphical or visualization component, but for projects that are more like traditional print works just moved into web-based or other digital forms, I think peer review would be better focused on the content and expression of the ideas in the work. I'm concerned that if design received too much emphasis, scholars might be tempted to focus on flashy design to conceal shortcomings in their scholarship.  

In previous weeks, we've talked about collaboration as a distinguishing feature of digital humanities, and I see collaboration as something that could also help scholars keep up with changing demands for design. I wouldn't expect each individual scholar to do all the design work (or the work in general) alone on a project if the scholar didn't want to. The design work could be handled by a collaborator who received appropriate credit. What is appropriate credit is something that the disciplines can establish as they continue the larger debate about how to credit collaborative work.
