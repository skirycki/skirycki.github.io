**Week 4**

While working on a Powerpoint presentation this week, I thought about the role design was playing in the scholarly output I produced. I have no formal training in design, so I consider my design approach as one of amateurism driven by instinct, abetted by technology, and constrained by the amount of time I have available to complete a project.

To illustrate: I had neither the time nor the skill set to create a good-looking Powerpoint from scratch. Thus, I went to templates. The presentation related to the Apollo 15 moon mission, and instinct told me to pick a theme that suggested outer space. I found a template close to what I wanted in the set of templates that came preloaded with my installation of Powerpoint. I could have searched for additional templates, but here the available time constrained my design choice. I decided to use the template that was close, and "make it work."

Using a template means my design ideas are filtered through the work done by the designer who built the template. I can't go so far as to call myself a collaborator with the designer of the template, but I'd like to think that I'm more than a freeloader. I locate template use in an ethos similar to that cultivated in the programming classes I have taken: sure copying and pasting pre-existing code is lazy, but the culture doesn't frown upon it.
